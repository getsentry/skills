# Skill Writer

Use this as the single canonical workflow for skill creation and improvement.
Primary success condition: maximize high-value input coverage before authoring while minimizing wasted runtime tokens.

Load only the path(s) required for the task. `SKILL.md` is the primary router: every bundled reference file should have a direct "open when..." reason here.

## Step 1: Resolve target, path, and shape

1. Resolve the intended operation (`create`, `update`, `synthesize`, `iterate`) and inspect workspace prior art before choosing where files belong.
2. Choose the target skill root from observed conventions. If the canonical location is still unclear after inspection, ask one direct question before editing files.
3. Read `references/mode-selection.md` to choose the minimum required workflow paths.
4. Read `references/execution-shapes.md` to choose the primary execution shape.
5. Default to the simplest adequate shape. If selecting a more complex shape, record why simpler shapes were rejected.
6. Load only the exact artifact-layout, workflow-mechanic, and provider-specific leaf files required by that shape.
7. Record portability implications before using provider-specific mechanics.

## Step 2: Run synthesis when needed

Read `references/synthesis-path.md`.

1. Use this path for new skills, material changes, and research-first planning.
2. Collect and score relevant sources with provenance.
3. Read `references/source-discovery.md` when source material is thin, stale, or ambiguous.
4. Produce source-backed decisions and coverage/gap status, including the class and execution-shape choice.
5. Load example profiles only when they add concrete depth for the selected class or shape.
6. If the skill uses provider-specific mechanics, include current official provider docs and capture usage constraints.
7. Do not move to authoring until depth gates pass.

## Step 3: Run iteration first when improving from outcomes/examples

Read `references/iteration-path.md` first when selected path includes `iteration` (for example operation `iterate`).

1. Capture and anonymize examples with provenance.
2. Read `references/iteration-evidence.md` when examples should persist beyond the current turn.
3. Re-evaluate skill behavior against working and holdout slices.
4. Propose improvements from positive/negative/fix evidence.
5. Carry concrete behavior deltas into authoring.

Skip this step when selected path does not include `iteration`.

## Step 4: Author or update skill artifacts

Read `references/authoring-path.md`.

1. Write or update `SKILL.md` in imperative voice with trigger-rich description.
2. Keep `SKILL.md` as the runtime router, not an encyclopedia.
3. Read `references/reference-architecture.md` before adding bulk instructions or new reference files.
4. Create or update `SPEC.md` using `references/spec-template.md` when creating a new skill or materially changing its contract.
5. Create focused reference files, subfolders, scripts, and assets only when each one has a clear "open when..." reason.
6. If you add a bundled reference file, add a direct routing entry for it in this `SKILL.md`.
7. Prefer checklists, tables, templates, and input/output examples over explanatory prose.
8. Follow only the specific artifact-layout, workflow-mechanic, Claude-specific, and output-contract references selected for this skill.
9. For advanced execution shapes, add the required routing, delegation, or safety contracts before considering the skill complete.
10. For authoring/generator skills, include transformed examples in references:
   - happy-path
   - secure/robust variant
   - anti-pattern + corrected version

## Step 5: Optimize description quality

Read `references/description-optimization.md`.

1. Validate should-trigger and should-not-trigger query sets.
2. Reduce false positives and false negatives with targeted description edits.
3. Keep trigger language generic across providers unless the skill is intentionally provider-specific.

## Step 6: Evaluate only when needed

1. Read `references/evaluation-path.md` only when the user asks for evaluation, the change is high-risk, or the architecture choice is non-obvious.
2. If you run evaluation, start with the lightweight qualitative check.
3. Run deeper evals only when requested or risk warrants it.
4. Record outcomes and unresolved risks when evaluation is run.

## Step 7: Register and validate

Read `references/registration-validation.md`.

1. Apply repository registration steps for the active layout you verified in the workspace.
2. Run quick validation with strict depth gates.
3. Reject shallow outputs that fail depth gates or required artifact checks.

## Output format

Return:

1. `Summary`
2. `Changes Made`
3. `Validation Results`
4. `Open Gaps`
