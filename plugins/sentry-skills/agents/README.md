# Subagents

This directory contains subagent definitions for use with Claude Code.

## What are Subagents?

Subagents are specialized AI agents that operate autonomously to perform specific tasks. Unlike skills (which provide instructions for the main agent), subagents run independently and can be invoked automatically by Claude Code when relevant.

## Available Subagents

### code-simplifier

**Based on:** [Anthropic's code-simplifier subagent](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official/blob/main/plugins/code-simplifier/agents/code-simplifier.md) (no license available - noted as prior art)

Simplifies and refines code for clarity, consistency, and maintainability while preserving all functionality. This subagent operates autonomously and proactively, refining code immediately after it's written or modified.

1. Create a `.md` file in this directory with YAML frontmatter
2. Include required fields: `name`, `description`, and optionally `model`
