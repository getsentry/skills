Skills are living documents that improve over time through small, iterative updates.\n\n- **Bias toward action** - Ship small improvements rather than waiting for the perfect solution\n- **Self-review is the default** - You know your changes best\n- **Iterate freely** - Don't hesitate to refine existing skills\n\n## Testing Skills\n\nBefore merging, test your changes locally:\n\n1. **Install the plugin from your local clone**\n\n   ```bash\n   claude plugin marketplace add ~/path/to/sentry-skills\n   claude plugin install sentry-skills\n   ```\n\n2. **Restart Claude Code** to pick up changes\n\n3. **Invoke the skill** in a relevant context\n\n   ```bash\n   # For explicit invocation\n   /skill-name\n\n   # Or describe a task that should trigger the skill\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify behavior** - Check that the skill produces the expected guidance and handles edge cases appropriately\n\n## Pull Request Workflow\n\nAll changes go through the PR flow, but formal review is optional.\n\n- **Self-review and merge** when you're confident in your change\n- **Request review** only when you want a second pair of eyes\n- Keep PRs focused - one skill or one improvement per PR when practical\n\n## Adding a New Skill\n\n1. Create `plugins/sentry-skills/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`\n\n2. Add required YAML frontmatter:\n\n   ```yaml\n   ---\n   name: skill-name\n   description: What this skill does. Include trigger keywords.\n   ---\n   ```\n\n3. Update `README.md` to add the skill to the Available Skills table\n\n4. Add the skill to `.claude/settings.json`:\n\n   ```json\n   \"Skill(sentry-skills:skill-name)\"\n   ```\n\n5. Update the skills allowlist in `plugins/sentry-skills/skills/claude-settings-audit/SKILL.md`\n\nSee [README.md](README.md) for the full skill template and optional frontmatter fields.\n",

Scope is optional. All lines must stay under 100 characters.\n\n## Commit Types\n\n| Type | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `feat` | New feature |\n| `fix` | Bug fix |\n| `ref` | Refactoring (no behavior change) |\n| `perf` | Performance improvement |\n| `docs` | Documentation only |\n| `test` | Test additions or corrections |\n| `build` | Build system or dependencies |\n| `ci` | CI configuration |\n| `chore` | Maintenance tasks |\n| `style` | Code formatting (no logic change) |\n| `meta` | Repository metadata |\n| `license` | License changes |\n\n## Subject Line Rules\n\n- Use imperative, present tense: \"Add feature\" not \"Added feature\"\n- Capitalize the first letter\n- No period at the end\n- Maximum 70 characters\n\n## Body Guidelines\n\n- Explain **what** and **why**, not how\n- Use imperative mood and present tense\n- Include motivation for the change\n- Contrast with previous behavior when relevant\n\n## Footer: Issue References\n\nReference issues in the footer using these patterns:\n\n```\nFixes GH-1234\nFixes #1234\nFixes SENTRY-1234\nRefs LINEAR-ABC-123\n```\n\n- `Fixes` closes the issue when merged\n- `Refs` links without closing\n\n## Examples\n\n### Simple fix\n\n```\nfix(api): Handle null response in user endpoint\n\nThe user API could return null for deleted accounts, causing a crash\nin the dashboard. Add null check before accessing user properties.\n\nFixes SENTRY-5678\n```\n\n### Feature with scope\n\n```\nfeat(alerts): Add Slack thread replies for alert updates\n\nWhen an alert is updated or resolved, post a reply to the original\nSlack thread instead of creating a new message. This keeps related\nnotifications grouped together.\n\nRefs GH-1234\n```\n\n### Refactor\n\n```\nref: Extract common validation logic to shared module\n\nMove duplicate validation code from three endpoints into a shared\nvalidator class. No behavior change.\n```\n\n### Breaking change\n\n```\nfeat(api)!: Remove deprecated v1 endpoints\n\nRemove all v1 API endpoints that were deprecated in version 23.1.\nClients should migrate to v2 endpoints.\n\nBREAKING CHANGE: v1 endpoints no longer available\nFixes SENTRY-9999\n```\n\n## Revert Format\n\n```\nrevert: feat(api): Add new endpoint\n\nThis reverts commit abc123def456.\n\nReason: Caused performance regression in production.\n```\n\n## Principles\n\n- Each commit should be a single, stable change\n- Commits should be independently reviewable\n- The repository should be in a working state after each commit\n\n## References\n\n- [Sentry Commit Messages](https://develop.sentry.dev/engineering-practices/commit-messages/)\n",
